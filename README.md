# 📚 Information Retrieval & Text Summarization

This project implements a simple yet effective pipeline for **finding relevant information in text collections** and **automatically summarizing long documents**.
The goal was to build a clean, modular, and understandable mini–NLP system that demonstrates skills in text processing, vectorization, and algorithmic thinking.

## 🎯 Project Idea & Motivation

Modern applications rely heavily on searching and understanding large amounts of text.
This project was built to show how to:

* Turn raw text into structured, searchable data
* Rank documents based on relevance to a query
* Generate short, meaningful summaries from long content

It demonstrates the fundamentals behind search engines, recommendation systems, and intelligent assistants — **without using heavy frameworks**.

## ✨ What the System Does

### 🔍 Information Retrieval

* Cleans and preprocesses text
* Converts documents into TF-IDF vectors
* Computes similarity scores
* Returns the most relevant documents for any query

### 🧠 Extractive Summarization

* Analyzes sentence importance
* Selects the key sentences
* Produces a concise summary that preserves the main ideas

### ⚙️ Why It’s Useful

* Understands the core logic behind IR & NLP
* Shows clear Python design and modular structure
* Easy to extend with embeddings or LLMs
